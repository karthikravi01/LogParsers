1. Create a parser for:
 - Dlt (Done)
 - Pcap (In progress)
 - Coredumps (In progress)

 2. Currenly the codebase is using virtual env, plan to make it dockerized so that it can be a seprate module.
 3. Make the outputs to .json(friendly for vector DB)





 
Questions:
    1. Pcap:
        1. what format to output the parsed data (.log, .csv, .json, etc)?
        2. what fields to extract from the pcap packets?

    2. Dlt
        1. In Dlt or other types of logs, is it recommeed to use some kind of batch processing 
        (like 10 at a time or someing like that). Right now it processes all the logs at once in input folder
        (might encounter time out?)
