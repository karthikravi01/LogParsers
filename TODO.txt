1. Create a parser for:
 - Dlt (Done)
 - Pcap (In progress)
 - Coredumps (In progress)


 2. Currenly the codebase is using virtual env, plan to make it dockerized so that it can be a seprate module.
 3- In Dlt or other types of logs, is it recommeed to use some kind of batch processing (like 10 at a time or someing 
 like that). Right now it processes all the logs at once in input folder(might encounter time out?)




 
Questions:
    1. Pcap:
        1. what format to output the parsed data (.log, .csv, .json, etc)?
        2. what fields to extract from the pcap packets?
